Trello TimeTracking is a Chrome extension to log hours on a Trello card.

How to use:

- install the extension
- refresh any Trello tab you may have already open
- open a card, you'll see a new "Hours" button: that's the sum of logged hours
- add a comment with the following pattern: `@h <hours:mins> <comment>`, e.g. `@h 2:30 logged two hours and a half`
